## üåê Open Source

Feel free to use it as a template for your own portfolio or any other projects. You are granted the freedom to modify, distribute, and use the code for any purpose, unleashing your creativity without any restrictions.

If you have any improvements, ideas or find any bugs, don't hesitate to submit a pull request or open an issue.

## üõë Important Note

1. **Do not push your Nodemailer pass on Github** as it can give access to your google email. Use `.env` file
2. Use [Nextjs api routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) for nodemailer transporters and send mail function as they only run on server and cannot expose your google app variables to client.

## ‚úâÔ∏è Setup Nodemailer

### Create Nodemailer User and Password

1. Go to your Google Mail app or any other Google App.
2. Click on your `Profile`
3. Click on `Manage your Google Account`
4. Go to `Security`
5. Under `How you sign in Google` go to `2-Step Verification`
6. Under `2-Step Verification` go to `App passwords`
7. Create an app (e.g., portfolio-nodemailer), and copy the generated password securely. Use it as the value for the `NODEMAILER_PASS` variable and your email as the value for `NODEMAILER_USER` variable in `.env` file. [Note: Passwords are not visible once closed; if forgotten, delete the old app and create a new one.]

### ‚ú® Seo

1. The project automatically generates sitemap.xml and robots.txt files within the public folder by leveraging the project's file structure. This process is initiated through the scripts located at src/scripts/generateSitemap.mjs, executed either after the project is built or by running the command `pnpm sitemap`.
2. It's important to note that [dynamic routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes), identified by file or folder names in square brackets (e.g., [segmentName], [id], or [slug]), are excluded from the sitemap.xml.
3. To facilitate Google Search Console verification, you can insert the Google Site Verification tag content within the `src/data/siteMetadata.mjs` file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development setup
